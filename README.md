# jena
A super minimal ZSH theme that just shows current directory, some cute stars, and some basic env information.

env information:
- git branch
- pyenv
- hostname if we're using ssh

Based on [elenapan's lena theme from her dotfiles](https://github.com/elenapan/dotfiles/blob/master/misc/lena.zsh-theme)
